2857,dHX4V1_LGnQ,Bailey,I seriously had to stop watching the video cuz you started saying BOSS soooooooo fuckin much for a while i went insane.
2858,dHX4V1_LGnQ,modaser stragon,Yo...im seeing this again in 2023
2859,dHX4V1_LGnQ,Ramy Fal,The AC thing is real<br>They do this to achieve very cold air out of the &quot;outdoor unit&quot; in the negatives <br>By runing the Ac as a Heater <br>The heat goes outside and the gouse gets very cold can go to -20¯C
2860,dHX4V1_LGnQ,Bkrispy,Peak time of YouTube
2861,dHX4V1_LGnQ,BrewdSherrito,What really blows is that being a sub contractor your boss sometimes tells you to do this dumb shit and it puts you in kind of a rock and a hard place. So normally I?d do what they say with enough witnesses and the owner would have a fit then I?d get to do it the right way. Most of the time it?s the worker that does it so just for the curious that?s a little explanation boss
2862,dHX4V1_LGnQ,Golden Eclipse,&quot;My boss told me to have a good day so I went home&quot;<br>I actually have a mug that says that. That&#39;s pretty ironic.
2863,dHX4V1_LGnQ,Lizzie,Those are done by the same people who say immigrants are taking their jobs ??.
2864,dHX4V1_LGnQ,Ranger Morgan,Fuck ups like honestly they suck so much
2865,dHX4V1_LGnQ,Mathieu Vaillancourt,"Normally, its because you know the job asked is dumb, and the boss is like &quot;dont argue with me or its your last job you&#39;ll be given&quot;."
