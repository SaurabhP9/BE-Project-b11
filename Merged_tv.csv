1,1HQIxRSpvyg,edward lewis,"sleep?  of course not.<br><br>&quot;caught having sex&quot;<br>disrespectful to be &quot;caught having sex&quot;, yes.<br><br>disrespectful to be making a bunch of noise, or even a little enough to be noticed."
2,1HQIxRSpvyg,Jo?o Nunes,"ahaha...u are troglodytes... both my two sons were MADE on my wife&#39;s parents bed when they went on a weekend vacation...lol...they had a king-size, and the wife insisted we should sleep there, so things happened...lol"
3,1HQIxRSpvyg,EPICWILTIME,I wouldn&#39;t. Never know if they installed cameras inside the room.
4,1HQIxRSpvyg,TOMS WILL,No it?s not. Especially if there married. And knocked out.
5,1HQIxRSpvyg,Sunshine Sunflowerz ??,"At 36 and 41, no I?m not having sex in my mother and father?s home; I even felt it was disrespectful when we did it in his father?s house. I?d rather wait or get a hotel/Airbnb."
6,1HQIxRSpvyg,carableu,I would rather have an unmarried couple sleep at my home during the holidays than potentially be on the road after a couple of drinks....
7,1HQIxRSpvyg,erikgracias,No wonder Julissa stays single lol she nag so dam much
8,1HQIxRSpvyg,Native 92,Hell no. Get your freak on. Mind ya daamn business
9,1HQIxRSpvyg,rochelle thundercloud,"I say,don&#39;t have <a href=""http://sex.no/"">sex.no</a> extra p.d.a. Keep it respectful. It&#39;s someone else&#39;s home."
10,1HQIxRSpvyg,Earl Hughes,"Y&#39;all are some prudes, and some of you just sound like some haters because you&#39;re not getting any. I am married and NO ONE will tell me and my wife when or where we can make love. I also don&#39;t care if my family members, INCLUDING MY CHILDREN have sex in my house if they&#39;re married. Hell, I&#39;d be glad that they love each other and can&#39;t keep their hands off one another. It&#39;s rude to subject other people to your sex though. No one should see or hear it."
11,1HQIxRSpvyg,Paula Laye,Well it depends If you&#39;re gonna make a lot of noise?????
12,1HQIxRSpvyg,Mike Killagreen,Everyone does it
13,1HQIxRSpvyg,Raven24,"nope its perfectly fine, don&#39;t care if you&#39;re married or not. If you are with someone it is perfectly fine to have sex and sleep in the same bed with your s.o. No one has the right to tell 2 people that they can&#39;t do something"
14,1HQIxRSpvyg,JGirlaa5,You can tell why some beautiful women have trouble keeping a man as soon as they open their mouths (*coughs* Keri)

17,1HQIxRSpvyg,melli fluous,Nothing wrong with that.??
18,1HQIxRSpvyg,Cymba McReynolds,I think it&#39;s disrespectful. Part of the reason some ppl are still virgins in their 20s is cause nobody can afford to move out and they not trying to sneak around in someone&#39;s house or public places
19,1HQIxRSpvyg,Pluto,???????? please... I&#39;m having sex.  I&#39;m not staying at someone&#39;s house for a week or more and not getting it on.  I&#39;ll be discreet about it though... they&#39;d never know.

181,zxLczePhHU0,rithu,Can anyone point me to the full version of this video..this is interesting
182,zxLczePhHU0,Ian D. Severson,Great advice
183,zxLczePhHU0,I'll fight u in Comments,The so called &quot;Cookies&quot; are high mileage and they act like its vergin. Using cookies to keep stringing men along...those days are over. Wait 90 days to have sex? Boy you out your mind. Hell even the women don&#39;t even wanna that long. He already did do men and women but problem is he can&#39;t pander and lie to these women because he knows the men are watching lolz
184,zxLczePhHU0,G Q,Why don&#39;t he just say what God says in the bible? I guess he won&#39;t sell no books ??
185,zxLczePhHU0,M,"I have several relatives and friends who waited to have sex until they got married. The guys always knew that it was what the ladies wanted, they all got married and have been married for over 10 years. Most of the engagements lasted a year. Men will definitely wait more than 90 days! 90 days os the value that you give yourself? You?re worth a lot more than that. Find a guy that shares similar values."
186,zxLczePhHU0,Seoul SeokJin,"Women always ?what did I do wrong that makes him?..?? Gosh, exhausted to hear that?Have some self worth pls. All men are not dogs, sometimes just not compatible to you. But stop go to that ?what did I do wrong? place immediately. Having said that, it?s different from never do self reflection or ?love me JUST the way I am? and never care about self development."
187,zxLczePhHU0,Vidya Madamanchi,Steve is the sweetest guy
188,zxLczePhHU0,Shrestha chauhan??,"Ladies : we got a loose grumpy cookie ????<br>Le Guys : then we got a freaking large baguette ?????????? , <br>Play with that smashed cookie whole life ??????????????????"
189,zxLczePhHU0,I-X X-l,"and that is why there are too many women in this generation that are single, and the divorce rate are high in the sky lol"
190,zxLczePhHU0,"W,A,J,D bo3",Yeah but if I don&#39;t get the cookie I just move to next one is that simple or go to a go go bar and is a lot more fun
191,zxLczePhHU0,I?M?A?N?I X,He should do a segment with just Gen z adult women
192,zxLczePhHU0,mary Ihezie,Love how Steve Harvey keeps it 100.??

194,zxLczePhHU0,Giovanna Vasconcelos,"90 days isn&#39;t long to me. I could go on a character for 3 months, and I think many guys can too"
195,zxLczePhHU0,Clareblue Tarot,Steve is a real man. A lot of these ?men?today were just not taught how to be a man. So sadly this advice is lost on them.
