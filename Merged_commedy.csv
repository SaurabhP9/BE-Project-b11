After he performs, during the time they kind of interview them while penn and teller discuss how they did their trick, he said he had worked with them when they called him and said they needed him to help with a trick for the tonight show where he would be in a monkey suit and play the tambourines. He was the monkey who ran out on stage, meanwhile teller grabbed the chicken because the girl in the monkey suite was already in the cage from the begining but was hidden from view behind a false wall. Notice there was a pinkish board behind the chicken, when they show the gorilla after the curtain comes up, the wall is gone and you can now see through the cage, and that&#39;s how they got the monkey in the cage that quik after it was just on stage dancing. It was 2 different ppl. If you want to see the episode I&#39;m talking about its s9 e3 and the magician is Alexander Boyce. The clip is on youtube."
