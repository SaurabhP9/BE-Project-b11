A 2 digits pao system (100 characters doing 100 actions with 100 objects) can work wonders. A 2 digits major system (just 100 images made up using an easy to learn code) can be built in like 2 hours and can also be very efficient. A 1 digit pao system (10 characters doing 10 actions with 10 objects) is super easy to learn and is perfect for people who just want to remember their credit card numbers and so on.

<br>e^x  is a higher or a lower growth  and all the growth or the compound interest is added  linearly as in ordinary addition where  1 +1 =2 .
<br>However when he said that i is the equate root of minus one,  he should have clarified it that two rotations of pi/2 will rotate a number by 180 degrees or pi  and so  the multiplying of two rotations  is an operation and its value could bring about the square root of a negative number but regarded as an operation of pi/2 rotation.  a rotation is a real activity and it is no imaginary number, <br>
<br> so e^ix could be looked upon as  a new bank where the interest on the capital is not added linearly with the capital but in quadrature ARCS as in tiny radians, as  what is meant by the pi/2 operator  we call I in mathematics and j in engineering,<br>
<br> So while e^x is a  growth where the added bits are in line with each other , e^ix is a growth where the added bits are added in quadrature or at pi/2 with the &quot; capital deposited&quot;  This growth is not in a line but will result in a constant capital and a growth in angular displacement hence a rotation,  so e^x is a normal bank where the interst is added in line and e^ix is a bank which adds the interest in quadrature with the cptal hence the &quot; original capital &quot; will    rotate by the amount x in radians.

349,v0YEaeIClKY,Stuffin'Round,<b>in a Danny Devito voice</b><br>I. Get. It.
350,v0YEaeIClKY,Carmel Pule,"Mathematical symbols are not merely symbols but they are real operator of activities around us and when one learns these activities then one is not so surprised at the meaning of the equations, 
<br>
<br>e is  related to puting money in the bank with 100% interest and e is the growth of a unit capital placed in the bank at 100% interest which  give compound interest continuously rather than annually. e is related to natural growth or decay of many natural entities.
<br>e^x  is a higher or a lower growth  and all the growth or the compound interest is added  linearly as in ordinary addition where  1 +1 =2 .
<br>However when he said that i is the equate root of minus one,  he should have clarified it that two rotations of pi/2 will rotate a number by 180 degrees or pi  and so  the multiplying of two rotations  is an operation and its value could bring about the square root of a negative number but regarded as an operation of pi/2 rotation.  a rotation is a real activity and it is no imaginary number, <br>
<br> so e^ix could be looked upon as  a new bank where the interest on the capital is not added linearly with the capital but in quadrature ARCS as in tiny radians, as  what is meant by the pi/2 operator  we call I in mathematics and j in engineering,<br>
<br> So while e^x is a  growth where the added bits are in line with each other , e^ix is a growth where the added bits are added in quadrature or at pi/2 with the &quot; capital deposited&quot;  This growth is not in a line but will result in a constant capital and a growth in angular displacement hence a rotation,  so e^x is a normal bank where the interst is added in line and e^ix is a bank which adds the interest in quadrature with the cptal hence the &quot; original capital &quot; will    rotate by the amount x in radians. 
<br>
<br>Then knowing about the bank that  compounds its interest rate in quadrature with the deposited capital then one can easily appreciate that e^ipi = -1 as jpi would have rotated &quot;the original capital 1&quot; by 180 degrees,<br><br><br>if we combine e^x with e^iy then we could have a rotating spiral growing or decaying .  desc ribed by e^( x+jy)  not that I am an engineer and I am in the habit of using J and not i for the p/2 rotating operator.  That equation is no more than beautiful  rotating structure.  brough tabout by two &quot; financial banks,&quot; one bank  e^x combining one&#39;s capital in a straight line for magnitude growth while the other bank  compounding e^jy the interest in quadrature  to produce  a compounded rotation,        That is  pure engineering and no mathematics and it is all real engineering and not a b it of it is imaginary!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !"
