12,IVQg3o2qTLU,Gary Jaguar,Very clever people the Asians
13,IVQg3o2qTLU,Charles Pancamo,1000 IQ play to get rid of the mother in law
14,IVQg3o2qTLU,Bob Latkey,Notice how the husband was smart enough to pause and grab the mother first so he could sacrifice her yet still play hero.
15,IVQg3o2qTLU,Thomas Wao,Yoo

21,7ebamFopT_0,Ranger1,Thank you for choosing Carnival cruises ??
22,7ebamFopT_0,Andrew Hulton,Are the buffets still open
23,7ebamFopT_0,Andrew Hulton,Attention the ship is going up.  Now down now up now down ??
24,7ebamFopT_0,Vq_lou,I was literally just looking at cruise prices. I?m cool now
25,7ebamFopT_0,vkhiev,Why did captain choose to go thru dangerous storm
26,7ebamFopT_0,Mike JC,Other videos show damage to only crew areas.  How was it horrible enough for passengers to be on deck recording videos??
27,7ebamFopT_0,KCY Jay,People would have complained if Carnival cancelled the the trip as well.
28,7ebamFopT_0,yumpladukfoo,Good....cruise ships are BIG FAT Americans anyway. LOL!!!  Shark food.
29,7ebamFopT_0,Tamerrae B,"How many people did they think were SLEEPING through that night?  Next time, make announcements throughout  the night."
30,7ebamFopT_0,SJP,Those ships are made for a lot bigger storms in the open ocean. Don?t let any of these passengers go transatlantic
31,7ebamFopT_0,Sheree Rockdaschel,All the more reason not to go on a cruise ship or any ship at all in the vastness of the sea. I am definitely a land lover. I love the sea to look at but it is for the creatures of the sea.
32,7ebamFopT_0,Jay Pence,I think the captain was too busy to go on the deck shake their hands.

35,7ebamFopT_0,Matthew Hahn,Oh dear
36,7ebamFopT_0,Morgan James,Abandon ship LMAO yes girl because jumping off of a perfectly good ship during a storm is wayyyy safer than just staying on it until the storm is over ?? you?re on the ocean bro. I don?t know why this is so shocking to you anyone
37,7ebamFopT_0,TheStiggggg,"Was it smart to enter a known storm ... no. Crew did a good job of keeping the ship afloat. The communication breakdown is a big failure, keeping everyone up to date vs suddenly calling abandon ship has drastically different outcomes."

A trans woman competing in women?s sports is going to get a lot of attention for their biological sex, more than they would if they competed with the men. Lia Thomas didn?t seem that traumatised when he was getting tons of media attention for being a man, or by the protestors, and he wasn?t too bothered either when he was smiling in interviews about his biological sex. When asked if the protestors put him off competing he said he just ignores them. Where?s the trauma about attention being drawn to being male? Or does it only affect you when you?re competing with the male athletes and you?re losing? How convenient."

1146,-9GIpOgGLz8,david clark,The John Birch Koch foundations have been stacking courts for 40 years to advance the John birch ideology. I cannot understand why people in the media cannot see this. I have been posting this for 5 years and it still is ignored. Just look at some of the clear evidence: 1. The John birch Koch foundations gave the maximum campaign contribution to every republican running for state and federal offices for 40 years. This ;amounts to billions and is to control the government. 2. The Koch foundations lobbied Reagan to drop the Fairness in Media Act with the long term goal to monopolize and Orwellian 1984 mass media and put together the monopoly of mass media the Sinclair Group with 193 members operating as a syndicate. 3. The John Birch movement never left it went behind the scenes and returned under a new name the Tea Party and the Freedom Coalition in the house of representatives. McConnell is the John birch leader in the senate and promotes all judges picked by the John birch Heritage foundation. McConnell was ordered by the John birch Heritage foundation to not bring Obama&#39;s pick for the Supreme Court up for a vote for 8 months to keep the John birch goal of stacking the court on pace. 4. The Koch foundations got Roberts to pass Citizen United to allow unlimited money in campaigns. I made a prediction that people should take notice of: I said Pat Toomey was the Koch brothers number two John Birchers behind McConnell and I believe the Koch foundations wanted him to leave the senate to take a high position in the John Birch Koch foundations. Remember before Toomey was a senator he was the president of the John birch foundation Club for Growth. The John birch Koch foundations believe Toomey could do more heading a foundation than being just one vote in the senate. Now that the John birchers have 6 members on the Supreme Court look for the worst decisions to come down in the next year.

2861,dHX4V1_LGnQ,BrewdSherrito,What really blows is that being a sub contractor your boss sometimes tells you to do this dumb shit and it puts you in kind of a rock and a hard place. So normally I?d do what they say with enough witnesses and the owner would have a fit then I?d get to do it the right way. Most of the time it?s the worker that does it so just for the curious that?s a little explanation boss
